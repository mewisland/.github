Your goal is to generate a new test code.

Requirements for the test code:

- Use `vitest`.
- Design tests to be resilient to parallel execution.
- Use `describe.for` or `it.for` when applying parameterized tests.
- Consolidate into a single file when generating test cases dynamically.
- Use `describe.concurrent` or `it.concurrent` when parallel execution is intended.
